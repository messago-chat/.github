# Messago

Hi! We are Messago team, a team of two people building a social media platform for users to be updated and for the users to update others about different news, topics, and such.

The main project is (hence our team name) the Messago app. Most of the stuff are built on top sending the news through API (both official, and third-party) using HTTP requests, and to percieve them as news and posts for the users.
